# Returns & Exchanges (Sanitized Retail)

**Standard return window:** 14 days from delivery or in-store pickup date.  
**Condition:** Items must be in like-new condition with original packaging and receipt/order number.  
**Refund method:** Original payment method within 5–10 business days (timing varies by bank).  
**Exceptions:** Final-sale items cannot be returned. Digital services are non-refundable.

**In-store return:** Bring the item + proof of purchase.  
**Mail return:** Eligible orders may request a return label; shipping fees may apply.

## Guardrails
- If the return window passed, do **not** promise exceptions—offer escalation.
