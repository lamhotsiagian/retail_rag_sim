# Pickup & Reservation (Sanitized Retail)

**Pickup eligibility:** Some items can be reserved for pickup at selected stores.  
**Verification:** Pickup requires a valid government ID and the order confirmation.  
**Pickup person:** You may designate an alternate pickup person, but identity verification is required.

**Late pickup:** Orders are held up to 3 days after confirmation (store-dependent).
